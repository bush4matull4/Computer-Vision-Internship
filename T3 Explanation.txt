TASK 3 REPORT — Video to Frames to Processed Video
Task Title:

Video Frame Extraction and Object Detection

Objective:

To convert a video into image frames, detect objects in each frame using YOLOv8, and then reconstruct a processed video with detected results.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python 3.12

FFmpeg (for video–frame conversion)

Ultralytics YOLOv8 (for object detection)

VS Code (IDE)

Command Prompt / PowerShell

Process Explanation:

Video to Frames Conversion:
The given video was first converted into multiple image frames using FFmpeg. Each frame represents a single moment of the video.

Object Detection on Frames:
The extracted frames were processed using the YOLOv8 model. The model detected and labeled all visible objects in each frame.

Reconstruction to Processed Video:
After detection, all processed frames were combined back into a single video. The final video displayed bounding boxes and class labels on detected objects.

Result:
The final output video clearly showed all detected objects frame by frame, confirming successful object detection and video reconstruction.
