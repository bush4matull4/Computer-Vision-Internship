Task 2: Multiple Image Object Detection & Segmentation

Author: Bushra Amatulla

ðŸ”¹ Objective

To perform Object Detection and Segmentation on multiple images using YOLOv8 model and analyze its performance metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed

Created a Python script multi_img_seg.py to process multiple images automatically from the images/ folder.

Used YOLOv8x model (yolov8x.pt) for object detection.

Executed the model to predict and save processed outputs in runs/detect/predict and runs/segment/predict.

Verified number of detected objects (bounding boxes) for each image.

Observed performance metrics from the generated files.

ðŸ”¹ Metrics Observed

Box F1 Curve: Represents the F1-score (Precision + Recall balance) for object detection.

BoxP Curve (Precision): Measures how many predicted objects were correct.

BoxR Curve (Recall): Measures how many real objects were correctly detected.

Box PR Curve: Combines Precision vs Recall to evaluate model performance visually.

ðŸ”¹ Results Summary

The model successfully detected and segmented objects in all input images.

Generated output images were saved in the runs/ directory.

Metrics show good detection accuracy with balanced precision and recall.
